## [HW1](https://github.com/yongkyung-oh/CMU-ML_for_Text_Mining/tree/master/HW1)
Link Analysis: In this assignment, I developed the **PageRank algorithm** and its personalized variants and compare them empirically on the provided CiteEval dataset. This assignment consists of two major sections:
* Implementation: Write a program to compute PageRank, Personalized PageRank, and Query-sensitive PageRank for the documents in the CiteEval dataset.
* Retrieval: Devising ways of combining PageRanks scores with the provided search-relevance scores to perform retrieval for the provided user-query pairs


## [HW2](https://github.com/yongkyung-oh/CMU-ML_for_Text_Mining/tree/master/HW2)
This assignment is targetting for implemeting **collaborative filtering system** for movie rating. Use the subset of data from Netflix. 
1. Reading in the data from the Netflix Prize subset
2. Producing a prediction for the rating of each user-movie pair in the development/test le
3. Writing those predictions to a log file using the specified format. 


## [HW3](https://github.com/yongkyung-oh/CMU-ML_for_Text_Mining/tree/master/HW3)
Deep Learning for Text Classification: In this assignment, I tried to implement text classifiers using Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), to train word embeddings on large corpus and try to use the pre-trained embeddings to improve the classification performance.


## [HW4](https://github.com/yongkyung-oh/CMU-ML_for_Text_Mining/tree/master/HW4)
Support Vector Machines: I developed two optimization methods to solve the objective function of Support Vector Machines and compare them empirically on the provided dataset. 


## [HW5](https://github.com/yongkyung-oh/CMU-ML_for_Text_Mining/tree/master/HW5)
Rating Prediction from Review Text: I worked on a real world dataset from Yelp. The ultimate goal of the job is to predict the customer rating for businesses like restaurants based on the customer review text.

1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Problem Modeling and Implementation
4. Feature Engineering (Continued)
5. Evaluation
